    <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:brown;">Bithoor</h1>

    <p><i>Bithoor or Bithur is a town in Kanpur District, in Uttar Pradesh, India. Bithoor is situated on the right bank of the Ganga, and is a centre of Hindu pilgrimage. According to Hindu mythology, Bithoor is the birthplace of Lord Ram's sons Luv and Kush. Bithoor is also the centre for Revolt of 1857 as Nana Sahib, a popular freedom fighter who was based there. The city is enlisted as a municipality of Kanpur metropolitan area.</p>
    <p>Bithoor has been closely associated with the Indian independence movement, especially the Indian Rebellion of 1857. It was at one time home to many of the rebellion's most prominent participants including the Rani of Jhansi, Lakshmi Bai. During the British Raj, Bithur used to be part of Cawnpore district (now Kanpur) in the United Provinces. The last of the Peshwas, Baji Rao II, was banished to Bithur; his adopted son, Nana Sahib, made the town his headquarters. Bithur was captured by General Havelock on 19 July 1857.[2] The town was laid waste by the British who razed Nana Sahib's palace and the temples in the town in retaliation for the brutal killing of over 300 British men, women and children who had been lured out of their defences at Cawnpore with a promise of truce during the Siege of Cawnpore.[3][4] Britishers killed and hanged around 25,000 Bithoor men and women, including children, from 9 to 90 years of age. They hanged the dead bodies from trees so as to spread terror. Bithoor is the only town in the history where so many people were killed for revolting against the British empire. Adding to that India was the only country where the most people sacrificed their lives for the sake of obtaining freedom from British rule.</p>

 <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Pollution Threats/steps Taken:.</h1>
<p><i>
The major cause of water pollution in Kanpur is the toxic industrial waste which is discharged into the river.
Seven months after the plugging of Kanpur’s infamous Sisamau drain, which once drained nearly 140 million litres of untreated sewage into the Ganga and was a symbol of pollution in the river — the river continues to be unfit for bathing or drinking, according to a perusal of water quality.
Between June 2016 and November 2018, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) completed a ₹63-crore exercise to divert sewage from the Sisamau drain to two treatment plants in different parts of Kanpur and stopped the expulsion of the drain, which once emptied out as a massive waterfall, into the river.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px;">Awareness:.</h1>

<p>
<i>
1.	Restoring ecological flows at every point along the Ganga’s course.
<hr>
2. Preventing and curtailing all waste water, starting with sewage and industrial waste, from mixing with the river. This especially needs to be prevented along the heavily polluted Kanpur and Varanasi stretches of Ganga.
<hr>
3. Promoting massive water conservation and water resource management, inclusive of rain water harvesting schemes, at both centralized and decentralized levels within the Ganga River Basin.</p>
