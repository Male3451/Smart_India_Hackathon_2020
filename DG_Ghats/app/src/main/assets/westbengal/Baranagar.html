<h4>3.Kutighat:</h4>
 Kutighat has a small jetty with a launch service that ferries across the river, twice a day. As we trudged across the jetty, a sense of languidness prevailed – people sleeping on the jetty sheltered from the blazing sun, a few small boats plying their work, bamboo let out to dry on the banks of the river, two young college girls enjoying the feel of the place, much like us, fishing nets lying on the jetty and, in the distance, on the other side of the river, stood Belur Math, the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission.

 <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Pollution Threats/steps Taken:.</h1>
<p><i>
•	Untreated sewerage is the biggest problem of pollution in baranagar west bengal<br>
•	Over 7 billion litres of raw sewerage are dumped into the Ganga every day from hundreds of towns along the river and its tributaries, and almost half comes from West Bengal<br>
•	In reality, the situation is even more dire: From the glaciers of the Himalayas the river flows over 2,500 kilometres through the plains of India into the Bay of Bengal, collecting the toxic waste from the half billion of people who rely on the river, to become one of the most polluted rivers in the world. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) says only a tenth of the sewage produced along the main stream of the Ganges is treated at all.<br>
</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px;">Awareness:.</h1>

<p>
<i>
The only way forward, concentrate on ways to restore the flow of the Ganga and rejuvenate the natural processes and functions of the river system. River floodplains should be freed up to allow wetlands to act as natural filtration and give the river space to flood and flush out sediment and pollutants.</p><br>
