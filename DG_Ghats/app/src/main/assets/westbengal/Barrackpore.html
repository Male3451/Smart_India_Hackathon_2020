These authors generally referred to the country of a people variously called the Gangaridae, Gangaridai, Gandaritai etc. By the 15th and 16th centuries, Chanak and the other towns in the region had become populous river towns.The Statistical Account of Bengal by W.W.Hunter mentions the towns and villages of this subdivision on the banks of the Hooghly river as chief trading and marketing centres: "On The Hugli- Calcutta, the chief seat of commerce in India. Baranagar, Dakhineswar, Agarpara, Panihati, Sukchar- Khardah, Barrackpur, Nawabganj, Ichapore, Shyam Nagar, Naihati and Halisahar contain large bazaars for sale of miscellaneous goods.
Under the Mughal Empire, Bengal was divided into Circars, or administrative subunits, each of which was ruled over by a Mahal. The name "Barbuckpur", another name for Barrackpore, is associated with a Mahal in the Ain-e-Akbari. From the 17th century, the area was ruled over by a line of Zamindars based in Nona Chandanpukur, Barrackpore.
The first British barrack or cantonment in India was built in the town in 1772. After the British crown assumed direct control of India, the sprawling Government House and the Government Estate were built in Barrackpore to provide the viceroy with a suburban residence 15 miles (24 km) outside of Calcutta.
Two rebellions against British authority took place in Barrackpore in the 19th century. The first of these was Barrackpore Mutiny of 1824, led by Sepoy Bindee Tiwary.[6] In this rebellion, 47th Bengal Native Infantry refused to board boats to cross the sea for various reasons including social taboo "Kala pani (taboo)" to Burma in the First Anglo-Burmese War. Consequently, British-manned artillery fired upon and "erased" them.[7] In 1857, Barrackpore was the scene of an incident that some credit with starting the Indian rebellion of 1857: an Indian soldier, Mangal Pandey, attacked his British commander, and was subsequently court-martialed. His regiment was disbanded, an action which offended a number of sepoys and is considered to have contributed to the anger that fueled the rebellion. In order to commemorate his sacrifice, a park named 'Sahid Mangal Pandey Udyan' was opened in the serenity of river Hoogly. The Army cantonment of Barrackpore also houses another significant historical landscape called the RCTC area, now populated by the defence quarters

 <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Pollution Threats/steps Taken:.</h1>
<p><i>
The major cause of water pollution in barrackpore is addition of 500 million litres of indstrial wasted from 700 highly polluted industries and thousand of tonnes of nono-biodegradable solid waste that are dumped into the river.
Director General of National Mission for Clean Ganga said, "It has been converted into a big nullah. At one point it was called Adi Ganga. So, it was the king of the river. But, it has degenerated over a period of time. We have some problems with that project. 26 MLD STP we want to construct and then intercept this sewage to that STP and clean it up. We have sanctioned the project and the state is calling up tender".Located on the banks of Hooghly, Barrackpur is now a densely populated city. It lacks sewage treatment plants, and consequently, its wastewater flows directly into the river.
Under the Namami Gange programme, work on a 150 km long sewage network is going on at a rapid pace. It will connect over 35,000 households.
The city's household wastewater will be diverted to sewage treatment plants with capacities of 18 MLD and 6 MLD, which are under construction.
The sewage treatment plants are expected to be operational by early 2020.

<h1 style="font-size:40px;">Awareness:.</h1>

<p>
<i>
Control of non-point pollution from agricultural run off, human defecation, cattle wallowing and the disposal of human remains in the river.
Research and development to conserve the biotic diversity of the river to augment its productivity.
Development of sewage treatment technology such as Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) and sewage treatment through afforestation.
Rehabilitation of soft-shelled turtles for pollution abatement.
Resource recovery options such as methane production for energy generation and use of aquaculture for revenue generation.
To act as trend setter for taking up similar action plans in other grossly polluted stretches in other rivers.
The ultimate objective of the GAP is to have an approach of integrated river basin management considering the various dynamic interactions between abiotic and biotic eco-system.
