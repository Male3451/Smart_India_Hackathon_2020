</p>
<h1 style="font-size:40px;">History:.</h1>
<p>From early historical period, geographically, this area had been full of swamps, natural riverine lake, low land, water bodies sparse village-settlements surrounded by deep jungle infested with wild animals of all kinds. Barring a few pockets, the area was considered unfit for human habitation.
However, around this area, there were several dozen villages more or less prosperous, such as Mallickbaag, Kanchanpalli or Kanchrapara, Bhawanipur, Ghoshpara, Chandua and Kampa. This area underwent development from 1862- the Sealdaha Kusthia Broad Gauge Railway Line, through 1863- construction of a 132000 m² locomotive workshop and railway station on the northernmost tip of Bizpur Mouza, undertaken by Eastern Bengal State Railway. In 1914 a carriage and wagon shop were added. Subsequently, a planned Railway Township was laid and built to the East & South West of the Workshops with a wide range of infrastructure - roads, drains, bridges, street lights, internal Railway lines, parks, Institutes, Administrative Buildings, Technical School, Hospital, Co-operative shopping stores, Bazaar, playgrounds for football, Tennis, golf, theatre attached to each institute (Hindmarsh Institute, Bell Institute, Spalding Institute), Officers’ Club etc. The resulting population increase caused the construction of huts and pucca buildings, necessitating the expansion of Municipal infrastructure beyond the Railway area.

This city was named Kanchrapara since the Railway Station at Bijpur was named after the then village Kanchanpalli or Kanchrapara. It was prosperous economically and culturally, being the seat of many stalwarts of Baishnab literature and early Bengali literature, as well as famous Vaidyas.

<p>
<h4>Rashmoni Ghat </h4>
In 1875, a miniature replica of Dakhineshwar was constructed in Barrackpore. This is equally beautiful and situated very close to Rani Rashmoni Ghat. This place is popularly called Annapurna MandirThis plot on which the temple stands, a hundred feet tall, was purchased by Mathur’s (Rani Rashmoni’s son in law) eldest son and therefore, this place is locally referred as the temple built and maintained by Rani Rashmoni’s daughter Jagadamba DeviDiwali is still in the air. During Kali Puja and Diwali, obviously all Kali temples are crowded. I and my mother decided to visit a Kali temple yesterday. I searched for the images of Annapurna Mandir in Google and was amazed to see the striking similarity between the two – Annapurna Mandir and Dakhineshwar.I made a mental note of the address (which I soon forgot), visiting time – when the temple remains open, asked a neighbor for directions and got started from home after some rest post lunch.
