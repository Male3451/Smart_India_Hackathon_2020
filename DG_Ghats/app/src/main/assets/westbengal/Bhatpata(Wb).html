    <p style="color:white; font-size:18px">Bhatpara is a city and a municipality of North 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA).
Bhatpara is situated on the bank of Hooghly river. It is known for its rich traditions in the field of Sanskrit learning.

It is one of the oldest municipalities in West Bengal and it was constituted a municipality in 1899, when it was separated from the Naihati municipality. In the British era and afterwards, it had become an important industrial hub on Hoogly river bank, mainly for the high density of jute processing plants.</p>

  <h4 style="font-size:40px;">HISTORY</h4>
<p style="font-size:18px;">"We can find the name of jagaddal as a village as long as 460 years ago in written records but the place is thought to be more 100 to 150 years older or maybe even much more than that. Bipradas Pipalai (1545 AD) in his work "Manasha Mangal" tells us through his protagonist character "Chand Sadagar" about Jagatdal. Chand Saudagar mentions in his "Kabi Kankan Chandi", Jagaddal as one of the places passed by him in his voyage down the Bhagirathi (the Hooghly) and where he saw many palatial buildings built by Brahmins and Kayasthas. Haldars were the most prominent Brahmins the others being Chakrabarties and Pakrasis.. Deys were the most renowned Kayastha family while Sarkars was the same amongst Mahisyas."<br>
<br>Pratapaditya (1561–1611 CE), The kayastha king and zamindar of Jessore made a couple of trenches and a fort at Jagatdal along with Mulajore, present day Shyamnagar as his military establishment against Muslim invaders.<br>
<br>According to Bengal District Gazetteers: 24-Parganas, circa 1914 "In Jagatdal the lines of two moats and two large tanks are reputed to be the remains of a fort erected by Pratapaditya in the sixteenth century"

<h4 style="font-size:40px;" >Pollution:</h4>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The rapidly growing population and industrial expansion in the city  has resulted in an increase in the generation of sewage, which  flows directly into the river.
Two STPs have been constructed in Bhatpara & Halisahar under the Namami Gange Programme. STPs will restrict the direct flow of sewage into the river.<br>
Two new sewage treatment plants (STPs) with capacities of 31 MLD and 10 MLD have been constructed in Bhatpara under the Namami Gange Programme. These STPs will restrict the direct flow of sewage into the river. Bhatpara is known for its rich traditions in the field of Sanskrit learning and for its jute processing plants is situated on the banks of the River Hooghly. A large  sewage network of 120 kilometres has been laid down in the city to curb the water pollution.
