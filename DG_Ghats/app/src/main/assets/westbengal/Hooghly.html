    <p><i>Hooghly district is one of the districts of the state of West Bengal in India. It can alternatively be spelt Hoogli or Hugli. The district is named after the Hooghly River.

The headquarters of the district are at Hooghly-Chinsura (Chuchura). There are four subdivisions: Chinsura Sadar, Serampore, Chandannagar, and Arambag.</p>


<h1 style="font-size:45px;">Hoogly River</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:40px;">History:.</h1>
<p>The Hooghly River (Hugli; Anglicized alternatively spelled Hoogli or Hugli) or the Bhāgirathi-Hooghly, originally and in local tongues the 'Ganga', and also called Kati-Ganga, is an approximately 260-kilometre-long (160 mi) distributary of the Ganges River in West Bengal, India.The Ganges splits into the Padma and the Hooghly near Giria, Murshidabad. Today there is a further man-made bifurcation of the river upstream at Farakka. The Padma flows eastward into Bangladesh, whereas the Hooghly flows south through West Bengal. The river flows through the Rarh region, the lower deltaic districts of West Bengal, and eventually into the Bay of Bengal. The upper riparian zone of the river is called Bhagirathi while the lower riparian zone is called Hooghly. Major rivers that drain into the Bhagirathi-Hooghly include Mayurakshi, Jalangi, Ajay, Damodar, Rupnarayan and Haldi rivers other than the Ganges. Kolkata and Hugli-Chinsura, the headquarters of Hooghly (district), are located on the banks of this river.
In its upper reaches the river is generally known as the Bhāgirathi, until it reaches Hooghly. The word Bhāgirathi literally means "caused by Bhagiratha", a mythical Sagar Dynasty prince who was instrumental in bringing the river Ganges from the heavens on to the earth, in order to release his 60,000 grand-uncles from a curse of the saint Kapila.
In 1974, the Farakka Barrage began diverting water into the Hooghly during the dry season so as to reduce the silting difficulties at Kolkata's port.
Like the rest of the Ganges, the Bhāgirathi-Hooghly is considered sacred to Hindus,[7] and its water is considered holy.

<h4>1. Nauka (boat) Ride </h4>

It is one of the most iconic and recognized buildings and a must-visit.

</p>
<h4>5. Hooghly Imambara</h4>
<p>
Hoogly Imambara
It is a huge two-story building built in 1861. It is a major religious center for followers of Islam. Excellently carved walls, sculptured texts of the holy book of Quran, massive pillars on the entrance & an ancient clock tower are some of the most mesmerizing features of this place. The northern block also houses a Mosque and southern block has been dedicated to the grave of the founder Hazi Mohsin. 

Due to the area’s cultural history, the diversity of the architecture and the various shrines are a sight to behold. Festival celebrations in this region are bombastic displays of culture and grandeur. Be it the celebrations of the Jagadhatri Puja, a massive Hindu celebration that takes place in November every year in Chandannagar and Krishnanagar, or the serene vistas of Triveni, where the holy rivers of Ganga (Hooghly today), Saraswati and Kunti once merged, the places one could visit are as abundant as they are beautiful. </p>

<p><i>
The Hooghly or Kati-Ganga flows south for about 260 km into the Bay of Bengal, through a heavy industrialised area ,dirty brick kilns and cozl-fired power stations can be seen pumping out waste into river and with more than half of West Bengal’s population. Household wastewater and industrial effluents flowing directly into the river are the major causes of its pollution. 
Tolly Nullah, a British-era canal, discharges a large quantity of sewage waste into the river. Under the pollution abatement and rehabilitation works, three sewage treatment plants will be set up with funds from the Namami Gange to stop the flow of sewage from Tolly Nullah into the Hooghly.
