  <p style="color:mediumblue; font-size:20px;"> Rishikesh<i>also known as Hrishikesh, is a city governed by Rishikesh Municipal Corporation (since October 2017),and a tehsil in Dehradun district of the Indian state Uttarakhand. Located in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India, it is known as the "Gateway to the Garhwal Himalayas" and "Yoga Capital of the World".It lies approximately 25 km (16 mi) north of the city Haridwar and 43 km (27 mi) southeast of the state capital Dehradun. According to Census of India, 2011 Rishikesh had a population of 102,138 making it the seventh most populated city in the state of Uttarakhand. It is known as the pilgrimage town and regarded as one of the holiest places to Hindus.Hindu sages and saints have visited Rishikesh since ancient times to meditate in search of higher knowledge.

In September 2015, the Union tourism minister Mahesh Sharma announced that Rishikesh and Haridwar will be the first in India to be given the title of "twin national heritage cities".[6] Due to the religious significance of the place, non-vegetarian food and alcohol are strictly prohibited in Rishikesh. The city has hosted the annual International Yoga Festival on the first week of March since 1989.

<h4 style="font-size:30px;">History</h4>
<p style="font-size:18px;">Rishikesh has been a part of the legendary "Kedarkhand".[14] Legends state that Lord Rama did penance here for killing Ravana, the asura king of Lanka; and Lakshmana, his younger brother, crossed the river Ganges, using two jute ropes at the point where the present 'Lakshman Jhula' stands today. The 'Kedarkhand' of Skanda Purana, also mentions the existence of Indrakund at this very point. The jute-rope bridge was replaced by a 248-foot long iron-rope suspension bridge in 1889. After it was washed away in the 1924 floods, it was replaced in 1927 by the present stronger bridge built by the United Provinces Public Works Department. This bridge connects the two districts of Tapovan, Tehri and Jonk, Pauri Garhwal. Another similar suspension bridge Ram Jhula was built in 1986 at nearby Sivananda Nagar.
<br>
<br>
In the contemporary history, one finds the mention of Rishikesh in The Gazeteer of Dehra Dun, by ICS office HG Walton. It reads, " A village or town beautifully situated on the right bank of the Ganges, on a high cliff overlooking the river. The place is developing very rapidly, especially since the construction of the new bridge over the Song river, an the realignment of the pilgrim road from Raiwala to Rishikesh.
<br>
<br>
The Ganges, one of the most sacred rivers to Hindus,flows through Rishikesh. Here the river leaves the Shivalik Hills in the Himalayas and flows into the plains of northern India. Several temples, ancient and new, are along the banks of the Ganges in Rishikesh. Shatrughna Mandir, Bharat Mandir (Lord Vishnu's avatar), Lakshman Mandir are the ancient temples established by Adi Shankaracharya. Shatrughna Temple is near Ram Jhula and Lakshman Mandir is near Lakshman Jhula.
<br>
<br>
The historical records mention that some pilgrims used to stay at Rishikesh as a resting place before moving onwards to the higher mountains for the pilgrimage while a larger number used to visit Rishikesh as the original destination and visited various sites between Rishikesh and Lakshman Jhula before returning.However, Rishikesh has in recent decades shifted from a pilgrim to a tourist town. The International Yoga Festival introduced in 2000 has brought new influx of tourists. Local markets have evolved from commercialising goods such as "local and religious handicrafts" to a more service-oriented tourist industry with "provision stores, cafes, hotels and yoga and meditation" as well as rafting.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:brown;">Devprayag</h1>

    <p style="font-size:18px;">Devprayag (Deva prayāga) is a town and a nagar panchayat (municipality) in Tehri Garhwal district in the state of Uttarakhand, India, and is one of the Panch Prayag (five confluences) of Alaknanda River where Alaknanda, Saraswati River (an underground river in Hinduism) and Bhagirathi rivers meet and take the name Ganga.</p>
    
    <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Overview</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">Traditionally, it is considered to be the place where sage Dev Sharma led his ascetic life, giving birth to its present name, Devprayag. It is one of the five sacred confluences in the hills and is an important place of pilgrimage for devout Hindus.

"Devprayag" means "Godly Confluence" in Sanskrit. As per Hindu scriptures, Devprayag is the sacred event of merging two visible heavenly rivers, Alakananda and Bhagirathi, to form the holy Ganga. Its believed that a third river, the mythical Saraswati river is underground and meets these two rivers at the confluence.
<br>
<br>

On a terrace in the upper part of the village is the temple of Raghunathji, built of huge stones, pyramidal in form, and capped by a white cupola.
<br>
<br>
Devprayag is the home of the late Acharya, Pt. Chakradhar Joshi (a scholar in Astronomy and Astrology) who established Nakshatra Vedh Shala (an observatory) in the year 1946. This is located on a mountain called Dashrathanchal at Devprayag. The observatory is well equipped with two telescopes and many books to support research in astronomy. It also contains about 3000 manuscripts from 1677 AD onwards collected from various parts of the country. Apart from the latest equipment, it also has ancient equipment like Surya Ghati, Dhruv Ghati, which showcase the pride of Bharatiya's progress in the field of astronomy. Shri Dr. Prabhakar Joshi and Acharya Shri Bhaskar Joshi (Popularly known as Guruji) are currently in charge and caretakers of the observatory.

Other than Sangam and Raghunath Ji Temple in Devprayag, visitors can visit sacred places like Mata Bhuvneshwari temple at nearby village Pundal, followed by Dhaneshwar Mahadev temple, Danda Nagaraja (Lord of Snakes) temple, and Chandrabadni temple.
<br>
<br>
Devprayag is the place where the rivers Alaknanda & Bhagirathi confluence. According to mythology, there is another river that belongs to this confluence named Saraswati, which originates from Mana Village in Badrinath. In Devprayag, the river comes from the feet of Shri Raghunath Ji in Raghunath Temple. Also, according to mythology, the footprints of Lord Rama are purported to exist at "Ram Kunda."

Triveni Ghat remains overcrowded with devotee to take ritual baths to get cleansed from their sins. It is believed that the ghat was visited by Lord Krishna when he got hurt by the arrow of Jara – a hunter. Being the most venerated ghat in Rishikesh, Triveni Ghat is even used by devotees to perform the last rites and rituals of their loved ones. The ghat is famed for the Ganga aarti performed to the chants of Vedic hymns. The sight of oil leaves, filled with diya and petals, which are released by devotees, floating on the pristine Ganga and the traditional aarti is a sight to behold.

    <p style="font-size:18px;">Triveni Ghat, which is a well known bathing ghat of Rishikesh, is a confluence of three sacred rivers that are Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. Various pilgrims visit this place to take a holy dip in Triveni Ghat, before visiting the famous temples of Rishikesh. According to the beliefs, a dip in water at this ghat washes away all the sins and purifies the soul.

The evening aarti, also known as the 'Maha Aarti', which takes place at this ghat, is the major attraction among the tourists. This aarti is accompanied by chantings of bhajan, beating drums, bells and diyas glowing all over the place. The devotees release small oil lamps placed on leaf boats in the water. These lamps floats down the river and provide a beautiful view. Ceremonies like 'Pindha Shraddha' in the name of ancestors are also done at Triveni Ghat.
