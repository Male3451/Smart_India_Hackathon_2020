    <h1 style="font-size:40px;color:brown;">Badrinath</h1>

    <p><i>Badrinath is a holy town and a nagar panchayat in Chamoli district in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is one of the four sites in India's Char Dham pilgrimage and gets its name from the temple of Badrinath.</p>
    
    <h1 style="font-size:30px;">History</h1>
    <p>Badrinath was re-established as a major pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the 8th century.In earlier days, pilgrims used to walk hundreds of miles to visit Badrinath temple.
The temple has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and avalanches. As late as the First World War, the town consisted only of the 20-odd huts used by the temple's staff, but the site drew thousands each year and up to 50,000 on its duodecennial festivals (every twelve years). In recent years its popularity has increased still more, with an estimated 600,000 pilgrims visiting during the 2006 season,compared to 90,676 in 1961.The temple in Badrinath is also a sacred pilgrimage site for Vaishnavites. Badrinath is also gateway to several mountaineering expeditions headed to mountains like Nilkantha.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Alaknanda River</h1>

    <p>
The Alaknanda is a Himalayan river in the Indian state of Uttarakhand and one of the two headstreams of the Ganges, the major river of Northern India and the holy river of Hinduism. In hydrology, the Alaknanda is considered the source stream of the Ganges on account of its greater length and discharge; however, in Hindu mythology and culture, the other headstream, the Bhagirathi, is considered the source stream.
<br>
<br>
The Alaknanda is considered to rise at the confluence and foot of the Satopanth and Bhagirath Kharak glaciers in Uttarakhand and meet the Sarasvati River tributary at Mana, India, 21 km from Tibet. Three km below Mana the Alaknanda flows past the Hindu pilgrimage centre of Badrinath.

River Alaknanda near Badrikashram
The origin of Alaknanda River is of special interest to the tourists who visit the important pilgrimages in Uttarakhand. The Ganges as Alaknanda rises in the southern Himalayas on the Indian side of the Tibet border. On the Satopanth Glacier 6 km up from Alaknanda's origin at its snout, the triangular Lake Satopanth is found at a height of 4350 m and it is named after the Hindu trinity Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva.
<br>
<br>
The five main tributaries joining with Alaknanda in order includes Dhauliganga, Nandakini, Pindar, Mandakini and Bhagirathi all rising in the northern mountainous regions of Uttarakhand. After the last tributary merging at Devprayag the river is known as the Ganges. The Alaknanda contributes a significantly larger portion to the flow of the Ganges than the Bhagirathi.
<br>
<br>
The Alaknanda river is among the best for river rafting in the world due to its high rafting grade. The Alaknanda system drains parts of Chamoli, Tehri, and Pauri districts.

<p>
<h4>Brahma Kapal Ghat</h4>
Brahma Kapal is about 2 km from Badrinath. It is believed that Lord Brahma resides in the Brahma Kapal Ghat (a place at the edge of a river). Want to know the mythical belief this place holds? Read on. Lord Brahma, as we all know, is believed to be the creator of the world and is typically shown having four heads looking in four directions. But legend holds that at one time he had five heads, the fifth looking in the upward direction. The locals recite the story as- Manmada who was the husband of Rathi Devi performed a tapa (penance) to impress Lord Brahma.
<br>
<br>
 Brahma Kapal is a ghat situated on the banks of Alaknanda River and is situated in the vicinity of Badrinath temple. It is a flat platform where Hindus perform several rituals and pay homage to the departed souls and also proffer sraddha to their ancestors..
 It is believed that Lord Brahma resides in Brahma Kapal Ghat. It is also believed that the head of Brahma had fallen off at this place. Travellers visiting Brahma Kapal can also visit Mata Murthy Temple, Sheshnetra Temple and Charanpaduka Temple which are situated nearby.

<p><i>
Ashes of dead bodies consist of bone, enamel and cartilage and traces of dentine. Scanning these components at elemental level provides an insight that it is dominantly composed of carbon dioxide, calcium phosphate, magnesium phosphate, sulphur dioxide and traces of nitrogen dioxide, nitrate oxide and nitrogen mono oxide. Due to pouring of ash of cremation ground of this Ghat into the river increases the BOD and COD, Nitrate level, Fluoride level etc., which adversely affect the aquatic ecosystem..<br>

Under the Namami Gange project, besides cleaning the ghats, Uttarakhand will also set up medicinal herbs and plants along the river banks.
After coming to power, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government made cleaning of the Ganga one of its top priorities. It renamed the Ministry of Water Resources as the ‘Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation’ and launched the ‘Namami Gange Programme’ “to accomplish... effective abatement of pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of National River Ganga” with an outlay of Rs 20,000 crore in its first Budget.
